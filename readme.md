10-12 pieces green capsicum chopped
10-12 pieces tomato chopped
20-25 sweet corn kernels boiled
4 tsp pizza sauce
1/4 cup mozzarella cheese grated
1 tsp oregano
1 tsp chili flakes
2 tbsp butter
Instructions
Collect all the required ingredients.
Heat a non-stick tawa and spread about 1 tsp butter on the bread.
Place bread slice on it. You can keep 1 to 2 bread slices at a time depending on the size of the tawa or pan.
Lightly toast the bread from the base.
Once the bread gets roasted from beneath, smear the butter generously over the top of bread.
Then flip it and turn off the flame.
Now quickly spread some pizza sauce on the lightly toasted side.
Top with small onion cubes, capsicum cubes, tomato cubes, boiled sweet corn kernels.
Sprinkle dried herbs like oregano and chili flakes.
Now top with generous amount of grated mozzarella cheese or pizza cheese.
Turn on the flame and cover the lid and cook on low flame until cheese melts completely and the bread is toasted. (takes 4-5 minutes)
Once the cheese melts, remove bread pizza with a spatula and place it on a serving plate.
Serve bread pizza hot plain or accompanied with tomato ketchup.
Notes
If you do not have pizza sauce then you may replace with any tomato sauce.
Cover the bread pizza with a lid else the cheese does not melt easily.
Do use a heavy tawa or pan or else the bread can get too much browned or burnt from the bottom. Also, keep the flame to its lowest when making the entire recipe.
Chop all the veggies and keep it ready before you start preparing the pizza.
Do not add too many toppings to this recipe and try to keep it simple.
You can even use pizza seasoning instead of adding dried herbs separately.
Use freshly prepared pizza sauce for more flavors.
Top with basil leaves for extra flavors.
You can use wheat bread or even brown bread for this pizza recipe.
